Certainly! Let's break down the code snippet you provided step by step with an example:

Given the initial linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and m = 2, n = 4

1. `let current = prev.next;`
   - In our example, `prev` is pointing to node 1, so `current` will point to node 2.

2. `for (let i = 0; i < n - m; i++) 
   - This loop will iterate from 0 to 2 (n - m = 4 - 2 = 2) in our example.

3. First iteration:
   - `const temp = current.next;`
     - `temp` will point to node 3.

   - `current.next = temp.next;`
     - This will make node 2 point to node 4, skipping node 3.

   - `temp.next = prev.next;`
     - Node 3 will now point to node 2.

   - `prev.next = temp;`
     - Node 1 will now point to node 3.

After the first iteration, the linked list will look like: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5

4. Second iteration:
   - `const temp = current.next;`
     - `temp` will point to node 4.

   - `current.next = temp.next;`
     - This will make node 2 point to node 5, skipping node 4.

   - `temp.next = prev.next;`
     - Node 4 will now point to node 3.

   - `prev.next = temp;`
     - Node 1 will now point to node 4.

After the second iteration, the linked list will look like: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5

This process effectively reverses the portion of the linked list between positions `m` and `n`.
